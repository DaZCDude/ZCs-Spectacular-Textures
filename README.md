I got pretty dissappointed after textures.com decided to make all textures cost money. So i thought i wanted to share my own textures with yall for free.

I essentially just want you to basically use these textures to whatever you want.
Use the Github Page if you want the best experience.

All photos are taken and edited by me :D

Contact support@zctextures.com if you have any suggestions for the site.
